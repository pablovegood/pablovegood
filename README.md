    <h2>ðŸ”­ About Me</h2>
    <p>As far as I'm aware my name is Pablo and I graduated last year from a BSc in Computer Science specializing in software engineering at the University of Granada. The thing is that I didn't know what to study and chose that degree basically because I didn't know much about techy things (and could discover a whole new world) and because I liked videogames. I ended up liking it a lot. Good for me!!
